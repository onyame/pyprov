-----
Running PyProv

Pre-Condition
* A running Neo4J Server

Running the application
* Run main.py

Terminating the application
* Exit PyProv

-----
Sending data to PyProv

* The only currently implemented view for PyProv is for saving general provenance information. The URL for that is 'http://localhost:5000/prov/general'.
* If you send a request via GET, you'll get a string containing a short description about the required and optional parameters.
* To save data, you have to send a request via POST containing all required data in JSON-format. Make sure to set the Content-Type to 'application/json'.

Here is an example, how the JSON-data could look like:
{
	"process":"process1",
	"input":[
		{
			"identifier":"id1",
			"version":1
		},
		{
			"identifier":"id1",
			"version":2
		}
	],
	"output":[
		{
			"identifier":"id3",
			"version":1
		}
		],
	"actor":"clemens"	
}
Note that for general provenance, you have to specify one process, one or more input and output parameters and one actor

If the request was correctly processed and all data saved, you will get an '200 OK'-Status response containing a string 'True'.
